## [v2.0-beta_0.3] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- **cert-init blocks nginx on fresh install** — The cert-init Docker service was failing with exit code 1 due to Docker Compose interpolating shell variables (`$SERVER_IP`, `$HOSTNAME`, `$expiry`, `$i`) in the inline entrypoint script as Compose variables (blank string). This caused nginx to never start since it `depends_on: cert-init: condition: service_completed_successfully`, making the entire web interface unreachable and preventing any user from logging in.
- **Inline script moved to `nginx/setup-sas-cert.sh`** — Mounted as a volume into the cert-init container. Docker Compose never interpolates file contents, only `docker-compose.yml` values directly.
- **Script rewritten as POSIX sh** — Was `#!/bin/bash` which is not available in the Alpine-based `alpine/openssl` container. Now `#!/bin/sh`.
- **Context detection** — Script detects whether it is running in the container (`/certs` volume mount exists) or on the host, and writes the cert to the correct location in both cases.
- **Skip logic** — Cert generation is skipped if `sas.crt` and `sas.key` already exist, preventing unnecessary regeneration on every `docker compose up`.
- **IP fallback** — Falls back to `127.0.0.1` if IP detection fails (was hardcoded to `172.16.0.168`).

### Workaround for existing broken installs

If nginx failed to start due to this issue, pre-generate the cert manually then restart:

```bash
mkdir -p nginx/certs
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout nginx/certs/sas.key \
  -out nginx/certs/sas.crt -days 3650 -nodes \
  -subj '/CN=sas.local' -addext 'subjectAltName=DNS:localhost'
docker compose up -d
```

### Fixed — Critical Baicells SAS Issues

This release resolves a series of root-cause bugs that prevented Baicells BaiBLQ firmware radios from transitioning from GRANTED to AUTHORIZED state in SAS mode 2. Radios were heartbeating indefinitely in GRANTED state and never enabling RF.

**Root Cause 1 — Timestamp format (PRIMARY FIX)**
- `sasFmt()` was producing compact UTC format (`20260603T025409UTC`). Baicells firmware silently ignores this format and leaves `SAS_CONFIG_TRANSEXPIRETIME` empty, so the radio's SAS client never knows when it can transmit.
- Fixed: `sasFmt()` now produces ISO 8601 Z format (`2026-06-03T02:54:09Z`), matching the WInnForum reference SAS (`fake_sas.py`) exactly.
- This is the primary fix — all other SAS protocol behavior depends on the radio parsing this timestamp correctly.

**Root Cause 2 — REM scan blocking OAM state machine**
- Baicells radios are factory-configured with `LTE_REM_SCAN_ON_BOOT=1` scanning Band 7 (2600 MHz).
- The OAM state machine requires `remScanDone=1` before it will allow `SAS_RADIO_ENABLE` to persist. Band 7 is never found in CBRS deployments, so `remScanDone` stays 0 forever.
- Any TR-069 write of `SAS_RADIO_ENABLE=1` is treated as a "dynamic configure" and immediately reset to 0 with the message `Now Nothing To Do For Dynamic Configure`.
- Fixed: provision tasks now push `Device.Services.FAPService.1.REM.LTE.ScanOnBoot=false`, `ScanPeriodically=false`, and `InServiceHandling=Disabled`. Also must be pushed manually to existing radios before reboot via GenieACS NBI.

**Root Cause 3 — Heartbeat response too verbose**
- Our heartbeat response included `heartbeatInterval` and `operationParam` fields. The WInnForum reference SAS returns only `cbsdId`, `grantId`, `transmitExpireTime`, and `response`.
- Extra fields were causing firmware to reject or misparse the response. Removed `heartbeatInterval` and `operationParam` from heartbeat responses to exactly match reference SAS behavior.

**Root Cause 4 — NTP clock skew**
- Radio clock was offset by up to 1 hour. `transmitExpireTime` was always in the radio's past, so the SAS client disabled RF immediately after every heartbeat.
- Fixed by configuring NTP server on each radio. The Time Server page (Chrony) enables setting a network-wide NTP source.
- Added `transmitExpireTime` debug log at level 20 showing calculated interval for diagnosis.

**Root Cause 5 — SAS.RadioEnable resets to False**
- In SAS mode 2, `SAS.RadioEnable` is a volatile parameter (`mibAttributeStorageClass=0`) controlled by the radio's SAS daemon, not TR-069.
- RF On/Off endpoint now also sets `Device.DeviceInfo.SAS.RadioEnable=true` when `sasEnableMode != 0`, in addition to `X_COM_RadioEnable`.
- Post-reboot provision task also sets `SAS.RadioEnable` conditionally.
- **Only set when SAS is enabled** — deployments without SAS are not affected.

### Fixed — SAS Protocol

- **Grant keeper** — Now catches grants where `grantExpireTime` is already in the past (previously only caught near-expiry). Renews `grantExpireTime` inline when renewing a grant.
- **Heartbeat handler expired grant** — No longer returns `TERMINATED_GRANT` when `grantExpireTime` is past and the radio is still heartbeating. Instead renews the grant inline, preventing unnecessary relinquish/re-register cycles.
- **`assignChannelSlot` null check** — `groupPolicy.customSlots` stored as `null` in MongoDB (not `undefined`) caused `null.length` crash. Fixed with `Array.isArray()` guard.
- **`UNSUPPORTED_SPECTRUM` on re-registration** — Radios hitting GPS delay window after reboot now wait the full 75 seconds correctly. Added info-level logging for GPS delay countdown.
- **Deterministic slot log** — `assignChannelSlot` logs at info level now (was trace) showing all serials in sort order for debugging.

### Fixed — RF On/Off Logic

- **`rf-all` endpoint** — Was fetching all devices with `projection=_id` only, then sending `X_COM_RadioEnable` to every device including Sercomm (which uses `AdminState`). Now fetches with `projection=_id,_deviceId,Device.DeviceInfo.SAS.enableMode` and filters to Baicells only (OUI `48BF74`).
- **Per-radio RF endpoint** — Now checks `SAS.enableMode` from GenieACS before deciding what to push. If SAS is enabled, also sets `SAS.RadioEnable`. If SAS is disabled, only sets `X_COM_RadioEnable`.
- **`rf-sercomm-all`** — Confirmed Sercomm-only (OUI `000E8F`). No changes to Sercomm RF logic.
- **Double POST bug** — RF endpoint was posting the task twice (silent + connection_request). Now sends once with `connection_request` only.

### Fixed — GenieACS Provisions

- **`default` provision** — Was declaring `InternetGatewayDevice.*` paths (TR-098 schema) hourly. Baicells uses `Device.*` (TR-181) so every inform produced a `9005 Invalid Parameter Names` fault. Replaced with a no-op comment.
- **`inform` provision** — Was declaring both `InternetGatewayDevice.*` and `Device.*` ManagementServer params, causing `too_many_commits` fault loop when `PeriodicInformInterval` differed from the provisioned value. Cleaned to `Device.*` only with `PeriodicInformInterval=5` matching what the NMS provisions.
- **GenieACS faults** — `9005` faults from `InternetGatewayDevice.*` params in the default provision stopped appearing after provision cleanup. Existing faults cleared via `db.faults.deleteMany({})`.
- **REM scan provision** — Added to `buildProvisionTasks()`: `FAPService.1.REM.LTE.ScanOnBoot=false`, `ScanPeriodically=false`, `InServiceHandling=Disabled`.
- **Post-reboot task** — Now includes `SAS.RadioEnable=true` when `sasEnableMode !== '0'`.

### Fixed — Spectrum Chart

- **Baicells grants not showing** — `getSlots` TypeScript return type in `frontend/src/api/sas.ts` was missing the `bands` array, so `slots.bands` was `undefined` in the frontend. Backend was returning correct data all along. Fixed type definition.
- **Slot matching overlap threshold** — Replaced exact boundary matching (`gLow >= s.low-1 && gHigh <= s.high+1`) with center-of-mass overlap matching (≥40% overlap). Handles Sercomm CA grants that don't align to Baicells slot boundaries.
- **Cross-group grant leakage** — Slot matching now filters grants by `assignedGroupIds` before matching, preventing Baicells grants from appearing in the Sercomm band chart and vice versa.
- **Unicode escape sequences** — `\u2013` (en dash) in JSX text content was rendering as literal `\u2013`. Replaced with actual `–` characters throughout `SASPage.tsx`.
- **Header button layout** — All SAS page header buttons (Verbose, Freq Debug, Refresh, Clear DB, Pause/Resume) now on a single line using `flex items-center gap-1.5`. Shortened button labels ("Verbose ON/OFF", "▶ Resume", "⏸ Pause").

### Fixed — Baicells Radio Card

- **EARFCN display in SAS mode 2** — Was showing TR-069 `EARFCNDL` value which is the provisioned value and never updated by the SAS daemon. Now calculates EARFCN from `sasReqLowFrequency` and `sasReqHighFrequency` center point, which reflects the actual SAS-granted frequency. All three radios now show their correct distinct EARFCNs (e.g. 55340, 55540, 55740).

### Added

- **Heartbeat transmit expire debug log** — Level 20 log on every heartbeat showing `heartbeatInterval`, `transmitExpireMs`, and calculated `transmitExpireTime`. Useful for diagnosing NTP clock skew issues.
- **GRANTED state debug log** — Level 20 log when a radio heartbeats with `operationState: GRANTED` (not yet transmitting), noting that `X_COM_RadioEnable` may be False.
- **`rf-all` now logs per-radio** — Each successful RF task logs `RF set on Baicells radio` at info level with device ID, enable state, and HTTP status.

### Changed

- **`sasFmt()` format** — Changed from `20260523T211500UTC` to `2026-05-23T21:15:00Z`. **Breaking change for any SAS client that expected compact UTC format**, but Baicells firmware was already rejecting the old format silently.
- **Heartbeat response** — Removed `heartbeatInterval` from response body. Removed `operationParam`. Only `cbsdId`, `grantId`, `transmitExpireTime`, `response`, and (when `grantRenew=true`) `grantExpireTime` are returned. Matches WInnForum `fake_sas.py` reference exactly.
- **Version bumped to `2.0.0-beta_0.2`** across `backend/package.json` and `frontend/package.json`

## [v2.0-beta_0.1] - 2026-05-29

### Added

**📡 CBRS SAS — Multi-Band & Sercomm Integration**

- **Multi-band frequency configuration** — SAS Configuration tab now supports multiple independent frequency bands. Each band has a label, EARFCN or MHz range, and max grant bandwidth. Different radio hardware types can be assigned different bands (e.g. Baicells on 3560–3620 MHz, Sercomm on 3649–3700 MHz) without interfering with each other's slot assignments.

- **Three-level Band Assignment system** — New `sas_group_policies` and `sas_cbsd_policies` MongoDB collections. `resolveBand()` function in `SasService` applies priority: (1) per-CBSD override keyed by `fccId:serial` (survives Clear DB), (2) interference group policy keyed by `groupId`, (3) global `findMatchingBand()` fallback. Both `spectrumInquiry` and `grant` now use `resolveBand()` instead of `findMatchingBand()` directly.

- **Band Assignment tab** — New tab in the SAS page (renamed from "Band Policy" to "Band Assignment"). Three sections:
  - *Interference Groups* — shows each registered interference group with a band selector dropdown, member count, amber warning when no policy is set, slot preview showing member count vs available slots (green/red), and a slot assignment table showing which serial maps to which EARFCN within the chosen band
  - *Per-CBSD Overrides* — compact table showing all registered CBSDs with serial, FCC ID, group, and resolved band (with override/group/default source label). Edit button opens a fixed-position centered modal (prevents clipping in table rows) with band selector and notes field; ★ marks active overrides
  - *No Interference Group* — CBSDs without a coordination group, note to set per-CBSD override or use global default

- **Band policy REST endpoints** — Six new endpoints in `sas-controller.ts`:
  - `GET/PUT/DELETE /sas/admin/policies/groups/:groupId`
  - `GET/PUT/DELETE /sas/admin/policies/cbsds/:fccId/:serial`

- **Band policy frontend API** — Six new methods in `frontend/src/api/sas.ts`: `listGroupPolicies`, `setGroupPolicy`, `deleteGroupPolicy`, `listCbsdPolicies`, `setCbsdPolicy`, `deleteCbsdPolicy`

- **Unified spectrum chart** — New `UnifiedSpectrumChart` component renders all configured bands and all active grants on a single 3550–3700 MHz axis. Shows band background shading, unassigned slot hatching, active grant blocks with serial labels, band boundary lines, MHz tick marks every 10 MHz, and band name labels. Only shown when 2+ bands are configured. Per-band detail charts continue to show above it.

- **HTTPS SAS endpoint (port 8443)** — nginx now serves a second `server` block on port 8443 with TLS, proxying only `/sas/` paths. All other paths return 404. A new `cert-init` Docker service (`alpine/openssl` image) auto-generates a self-signed RSA-4096 certificate with correct SAN entries (server IP, hostname, `sas.local`, `localhost`) on first `docker compose up`. Certificate is written to `./nginx/certs/sas.crt` and `sas.key`. nginx `depends_on: cert-init: service_completed_successfully`. `nginx/certs/*.crt`, `*.key`, `*.pem` added to `.gitignore`; `nginx/certs/.gitkeep` tracks the empty directory.

- **Sercomm SCE4255W full SAS provisioning** — Complete rewrite of the Sercomm ACS module Location & SAS card. All previously hardcoded SAS parameters are now configurable form fields with correct defaults:
  - *Method* dropdown: Direct SAS (0) / Domain Proxy (1)
  - *Installation Method* dropdown: Single-Step (0, `CPIInstallParamSuppliedEnable=false`) / Multi-Step (1)
  - *Category* dropdown: A / B
  - *Channel Type* dropdown: GAA / PAL (`ProtectionLevel`)
  - *Location* dropdown: Indoor / Outdoor
  - *Location Source* dropdown: Manual (0) / GPS (1) (`HighAccuracyLocationEnable`)
  - *Height Type* dropdown: AGL / AMSL
  - *Lat/Long* in decimal degrees — auto-converted to microdegrees on push (multiply × 1,000,000)
  - *SAS User ID* (`UserContactInformation`)
  - *SAS Server URL* (defaults to `https://<hostname>:8443/sas/v1.2`)
  - *Manufacturer Prefix* checkbox (prepends `Sercomm-` to serial, default checked)
  - *CPI Required* checkbox (Cat B outdoor only, default unchecked)
  - *Verify SAS Cert* checkbox (`PeerCertVerifyEnable`, default unchecked for self-signed)
  - *Enable SAS* checkbox
  - Also sets: `ManufacturerPrefixEnable`, `UserIDSelectMethod=0`, `HighAccuracyLatitude`, `HighAccuracyLongitude`, `HighAccuracyLocationEnable`, `CPIEnable`, `CPIInstallParamSuppliedEnable`
  - `sasServerUrl` and `sasPeerCertVerify` added to `SercommProvisionInput` type in both backend and frontend

- **SAS Log filter** — "Filter by CBSD ID" text input on the Logs tab filters displayed lines client-side by any string (CBSD ID, serial, IP, response code).

- **Quiet docker compose logs** — Per-request SAS protocol traffic (`spectrumInquiry`, `grant`, `heartbeat` requests and responses, band resolution, slot assignment, duplicate grant, grant keeper renewal) downgraded from `info` to `trace` level. `startSummaryLogger(30_000)` started in `index.ts` alongside grant keeper; every 30 seconds logs one clean line: `SAS ─ N active grants: \u25cf <serial> <low>-<high>MHz EARFCN:<n>`. `stopSummaryLogger()` called on graceful shutdown.

### Fixed

- **Per-CBSD override modal clipped** — `CbsdPolicyEditor` popover changed from `absolute` positioning (clipped by table overflow) to `fixed` modal centered with `top-1/2 left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2`. Transparent backdrop closes on click-outside.

- **Spectrum chart unicode escape sequences** — `\u2013` (en dash), `\u25cf` (bullet), `\u00b7` (middle dot) inside template literals were rendered as literal escape text. Replaced with direct UTF-8 characters.

- **Sercomm `HeightType`** — Was hardcoded to `AMSL`. Corrected to `AGL` (WInnForum CBSD spec requirement for indoor Cat A deployments) as the default, now user-configurable.

- **Sercomm lat/long format** — `HighAccuracyLatitude` and `HighAccuracyLongitude` were not being set at all. Now set from form lat/long fields converted to microdegrees.

- **SAS `spectrumInquiry` returning all bands** — Previously returned all configured bands as available channels. Now returns only the CBSD's resolved band (via `resolveBand()`), preventing Sercomm radios from being offered Baicells-only slots.

- **Sercomm SSL connect error** — Radio was configured with `https://172.16.0.168:8888/sas/v1.2` (HTTP port). Fixed by updating default SAS URL to port 8443 and adding a validation note in the form.

- **`useMemo` not imported** — `BandPolicyTab` used `useMemo` but it wasn't in the React import in `SASPage.tsx`. Added to import.

- **`isShared` unused variable** — Removed unused `isShared` variable from slot table row renderer in `BandPolicyTab`.

- **`sasServerUrl` not in `SercommProvisionInput`** — Added as optional field to type in `genieacs.ts` to fix TypeScript build error.

### Changed

- **SAS tab renamed** — "Band Policy" tab renamed to "Band Assignment" for clarity
- **`getSlotLayout()`** — Now returns all configured bands (not just first band) as a `bands` array with per-band slot data. Legacy flat fields (`bandLow`, `bandHigh`, `slotWidthHz`, `slots`) preserved for backward compatibility.
- **`findMatchingBand()`** — Still used as fallback in `resolveBand()` for global default; no longer called directly from `spectrumInquiry` or `grant`
- **Version bumped to `2.0.0-beta_0.1`** across `backend/package.json` and `frontend/package.json`

---

## [v2.0-beta] - 2026-05-27

### Added

**📡 CBRS SAS Server**
- Full built-in WInnForum SAS-CBSD protocol server implementing the complete CBRS interface: registration, spectrumInquiry, grant, heartbeat, relinquishment, deregistration
- Deterministic per-CBSD channel assignment keyed by `cbsdSerialNumber` sort order within interference coordination group — race-condition-proof, survives re-registrations and Clear DB cycles
- Interference coordination group support (`groupType: INTERFERENCE_COORDINATION`) — radios in the same group are automatically spread across non-overlapping 20 MHz frequency slots
- Multi-site scaling — independent slot assignment per group ID; multiple sites can reuse the same physical frequencies without conflict
- GPS delay enforcement — configurable lock delay (default 75 s, keyed per `fccId:serial`) before grants are issued, ensuring radios are GPS-locked before transmitting
- Grants issued directly as `AUTHORIZED` (not `GRANTED`) so radios enable RF immediately on first grant response without waiting for a heartbeat cycle
- `Pause SAS` / `Resume SAS` toggle button — when paused, all SAS protocol endpoints return `DEREGISTER`/`TERMINATED_GRANT`; radios stop transmitting without any data being deleted. Red banner shown on dashboard when paused.
- `Clear DB` button — wipes all grants and CBSDs from MongoDB and clears GPS delay clocks; radios re-register and get fresh deterministic slot assignments on next contact
- Spectrum chart — visual frequency band display with color-coded slots, EARFCN labels, and per-CBSD assignment table showing which serial maps to which slot
- SAS admin REST API: `POST /sas/admin/reset`, `POST /sas/admin/pause`, `POST /sas/admin/resume`, `GET /sas/admin/status`, `GET /sas/admin/slots`
- SAS config page — band low/high EARFCN, max grant bandwidth, GPS lock delay, heartbeat interval, default max EIRP
- MongoDB-backed CBSD and grant persistence

**📡 Baicells eNodeB Provisioning**
- Full Band 42/43/48 band selector with auto-fill button for band-appropriate defaults
- EARFCN dropdown per band — in SAS mode 2 the EARFCN field is greyed out and labeled `(SAS)` since the radio tunes to the SAS-granted frequency
- EARFCN mismatch warning when configured EARFCN doesn't match the expected SAS-assigned slot center frequency
- All SAS TR-069 parameters provisioned: `SAS.enableMode`, `SAS.RadioEnable`, `SAS.ServerUrl`, `SAS.UserId`, `SAS.CallSign`, `SAS.FccId`, `SAS.groupType`, `SAS.groupId`, `SAS.LegacyMode`, `SAS.RegistrationType`, `SAS.reqLowFrequency`, `SAS.reqHighFrequency`, `SAS.PreferredFrequency`, `SAS.PreferredBandwidth`, `SAS.PreferredPower`, `SAS.MaxEIRP`, `SAS.EirpCapability`
- RF enable sends task twice (queued + connection_request) to ensure immediate effect
- `rfStatus` correctly derived from `X_COM_RadioEnable AND opState` (not just RadioEnable)
- EARFCN not pushed to radio in SAS mode 2 (radio tunes to SAS grant automatically)

**🔗 Remote UPF / SGW-U Architecture (4G + 5G Edge Deployments)**
- **Remote UPF config generator** (UPF config page, Section 2) — enter remote site PFCP and GTP-U addresses, DNN, session pool, DNS; generates ready-to-deploy `upf.yaml`; "Add to SMF & Apply" button wires the remote UPF into `smf.yaml` PFCP client list automatically; full deployment steps included
- **SMF config page** (fully rewritten) — UPF routing table showing local UPF (labeled "same host") and remote UPF entries; routing criteria: DNN, TAC (decimal), eNodeB Cell ID (hex, 28-bit), NR Cell ID (hex, 36-bit); routing destination badge on session pools showing which UPF handles each pool; routable SMF PFCP address selector; "Remove All Remote UPFs" bulk action
- **Remote SGW-U config generator** (SGW-U config page, Section 2) — mirrors UPF generator exactly; generates ready-to-deploy `sgwu.yaml` with SGW-C address, PFCP server, and GTP-U server; deployment steps for `open5gs-sgwu` on remote host
- **SGW-C config page** (fully rewritten) — SGW-U routing table with local SGW-U (labeled "same host") and remote SGW-U entries; routing criteria: TAC, APN, Cell ID (e_cell_id, hex); routable SGW-C PFCP server section; "Remove All Remote SGW-Us" bulk action
- Cross-navigation: "Edit in Generator" button on SMF/SGW-C routing entries navigates to UPF/SGW-U tab and pre-populates the generator form
- "How it works" topology button on SMF and SGW-C pages — opens modal with network diagram, key point cards (control plane / PFCP / user plane), IP requirements callout
- Network topology diagram (SVG) embedded inline — central site (AMF, MME, SMF, SGW-C) ↔ edge site (UPF, SGW-U) with all interface IPs, PFCP/N4/Gxc connections, N2/S1-MME control plane (dashed), N3/S1-U user plane; clean orthogonal routing, no crossing lines
- `sgwc.yaml` and `sgwu.yaml` added to auto-config backup list and service restart list

**⚙️ Auto-Config improvements**
- "Use Local UPF Only" checkbox (default checked) — hides PFCP addressing complexity for single-server deployments; shows loopback summary `127.0.0.4 ↔ 127.0.0.7`; auto-detects from existing `smf.yaml` pfcp.client.upf list
- `mergePfcpServers()` helper function — prevents duplicate IP entries in PFCP server lists for SMF, UPF, and SGW-C; deduplicates existing entries; replaces all previous ad-hoc dedup logic
- `localUpfOnly` and `localSgwuOnly` flags — when true, forces loopback defaults regardless of any IP fields entered
- SGW-C PFCP auto-config — when `localSgwuOnly: true`, sets `127.0.0.3` as SGW-C PFCP server and `127.0.0.6` as SGW-U client

**🧪 Unit Tests (Jest)**
- 32 unit tests for RAN UE session reporting in `backend/src/__tests__/active-sessions.test.ts`
- Coverage: 4G/5G UE detection, IMSI field variants (`supi` vs `imsi`, `imsi-` prefixed vs bare), UE deduplication, live eNodeB/gNodeB filter (setup_success), Prometheus metrics fallback, interface status (S1-MME, S1-U, N2, N3)
- `parsePeerIP` helper tests (bracketed IPv4, bracketed IPv6, plain `IP:port`, bare IP)
- `ts-jest` and `@types/jest` added to backend devDependencies; `jest` config added to `backend/package.json`
- Dockerfile updated to always use `npm install` (no lock file sync issues)

### Fixed

- **RAN page crash** — `mmeUe.supi` null guard added with fallback to `imsi` field for Open5GS versions that use `imsi` instead of `supi`. Crash was dropping all 4G UEs from display after the first malformed entry.
- **RAN page live eNodeB filter too strict** — `setup_success: false` was causing `liveEnbIps` to be empty, silently dropping all 4G UEs. Filter now only skips UEs whose specific radio IP is absent from the live set; UEs with unresolvable radio IPs pass through.
- **RAN page 5G-only deployment** — `getActive4GUEs()` now short-circuits immediately when both MME `/ue-info` and `/enb-info` return empty (no MME running), avoiding redundant SMF PDU queries and a redundant `getActive5GUEs()` dedup call
- **Services page Stop 4G / Stop 5G** — Express route order bug: `/:name/:action` was matching before `/all/:action`. Fixed by registering `/all/:action` first in `service-controller.ts` and `sas-controller.ts`.
- **SGW-C and SGW-U metrics sections removed** — Neither service exposes a Prometheus metrics HTTP endpoint. Metrics blocks removed from `SgwcEditor.tsx` and `SgwuEditor.tsx`.
- **Duplicate PFCP server IP (auto-config)** — Entering a loopback address already present in the YAML created a duplicate `pfcp.server` entry. `mergePfcpServers()` helper prevents this for all services and self-heals existing duplicates.
- **SAS double EARFCN grants** — Previous slot assignment was sorting CBSDs by `cbsdId` (UUID, changes on re-registration) causing position instability. Changed to sort by `cbsdSerialNumber` which is hardware-bound and never changes. Also removed PENDING grant placeholder approach (race-prone) in favor of pure deterministic serial sort.
- **SAS RadioEnable not set** — Grants were issued as `GRANTED` requiring a heartbeat to become `AUTHORIZED` before `SAS.RadioEnable` goes true. Changed to issue grants directly as `AUTHORIZED` since GPS delay is already satisfied by grant time.

### Changed

- **Version bumped to `2.0.0-beta`** across `backend/package.json` and `frontend/package.json`
- **SAS slot assignment** — switched from `cbsdId` sort key to `cbsdSerialNumber` sort key for stable, hardware-bound slot assignment
- **`getActive4GUEs()` signature** — accepts optional `imsi5GSet?: Set<string>` parameter; when provided by `GetInterfaceStatus`, skips the internal `getActive5GUEs()` call to avoid redundant API requests
- **`GetInterfaceStatus.execute()`** — now runs `getActive5GUEs()` first, passes resulting IMSI set to `getActive4GUEs(imsi5GSet)` eliminating the double 5G API call
- **`TopologyModal`** — new shared component (`TopologyModal.tsx`) with inline SVG topology diagram, key point cards, IP requirements callout; used by both SmfEditor and SgwcEditor
- **README** — added CBRS SAS section with feature list and screenshot placeholders; updated latest release section to v2.0-beta

---

## [v1.3.6] - 2026-05-18

### Added
- **Radio nickname tags** — Tag any eNodeB or gNodeB IP with a friendly name (e.g. "Site A gNB", "Lab eNB"). Tags stored in SQLite (`radio_tags` table), persist across sessions, visible to all users. Admins edit inline on the RAN Network page (pencil icon on hover, Enter to save, empty = delete).
  - `SqliteRadioTagRepository` — new repository sharing the existing auth SQLite DB (`getDb()` exposed on `SqliteAuthRepository`)
  - `radio-tags-controller.ts` — `GET /api/radio-tags` (all users), `PUT /api/radio-tags/:ip` and `DELETE /api/radio-tags/:ip` (admin only)
  - `radio_tags` table added to `sqlite-auth-repository.ts` `initSchema()`
  - `radioTagsApi` added to frontend `api/index.ts`
- **UE nicknames on RAN Network page** — Subscriber nicknames (set on Subscriber page) now appear below the IMSI in both per-radio UE sub-rows and the All Sessions table. Enriched at the backend by batch-fetching nicknames from MongoDB after building the active UE list.
  - `getNicknamesByImsi(imsis)` added to `MongoSubscriberRepository` and `ISubscriberRepository` interface
  - `getActive5GUEs()` and `getActive4GUEs()` in `active-sessions.ts` now enrich each `ActiveUE` with `nickname` from MongoDB
  - `ActiveUE` interface: `nickname?: string` added in both backend and frontend
- **RAN Network page — wider layout** — Container widened from `max-w-7xl` (1280px) to `max-w-[1600px]`. Table cell padding tightened from `px-4 py-3` to `px-3 py-2.5`. IMSI and Radio columns given `min-w` so nicknames have room to breathe.

### Fixed
- **Femtocell — password/username re-probe on blur** — WebUI Username and WebUI Password fields now call `probeDevice(cfg.ip)` on blur when an IP is already entered. Previously the user had to retype the IP after entering credentials to re-trigger the probe.
- **MongoDB log spam suppressed** — `systemctl is-active mongod` failures are now logged at `debug` (not `error`) since they are expected when MongoDB runs in Docker. MongoDB Docker probe info logs throttled to once per 15 minutes (was every 5 seconds).
- **TUN interface creation — IP not assigned** — `ip addr add` was returning exit 0 but the address never appeared on the interface. Root cause: `executeCommand` (nsenter `-m`) enters the host mount namespace but not the host network namespace. Fix: use `executeLocalCommand` with explicit `nsenter --net=/proc/1/ns/net` for all `ip` commands. Confirmed working.
- **TUN interface creation — networkctl race** — `networkctl reload` after `ip addr add` caused systemd-networkd to flush and reassign the address, creating a race where `list()` ran during the flush window and saw no address. `networkctl reload` removed from the create/edit flow. Persistence handled exclusively by a systemd oneshot service at `/etc/systemd/system/open5gs-tun-<name>.service`.
- **TUN interface state detection** — State now derived from the `<...,UP>` flags field in `ip -o link show` output, not the `state UP` keyword. TUN interfaces with `NO-CARRIER` always show `state DOWN` even when the UP flag is set, so the previous logic always reported them as down even after `ip link set up`.
- **TUN interface — not detected as created** — `exists` was derived from `liveMap` which was built from `ip addr` output and only populated when an IPv4 was assigned. Interfaces without a yet-assigned IP were reported as `NOT CREATED`. Fixed: `exists` now derived from `ip link` output which lists all interfaces regardless of IP.
- **SMF/UPF — local UPF routing label missing** — SMF Session Pools now show a green "↗ Local UPF" badge for all pools with no matching remote UPF DNN rule (including the default no-DNN pool). Previously only remote UPF pools showed a routing destination badge.
- **YAML round-trip safety (all 16 NFs)** — `saveRaw()` in `yaml-config-repository.ts` now reads the current on-disk YAML before every write and deep-merges the incoming doc over it using `deepMerge(base, overlay)`. Unknown fields (manually added `dev:` bindings, custom `session` entries, extra top-level keys, timer sections) are preserved. Arrays are replaced not merged so deleting a session pool via the UI still works. Frontend editors for AMF NGAP server, MME S1AP server, and SGW-C GTP-C server fixed to spread existing server entries (preserving unknown sibling keys) rather than creating bare replacement objects.
- **SMF session pool ordering** — `auto-config.ts` `execute()` now sorts SMF session pools: DNN-specific pools first, default (no-DNN) pools last. Open5GS matches pools top-to-bottom and crashes on unknown DNN if the default pool appears before a named one.

### Changed
- **Tests infrastructure** — `tests/yaml-round-trip.test.ts` updated with correct run command (via backend container). `tests/run-tests.sh` one-shot script and `tests/README.md` added.
- **`iproute2` added to backend Dockerfile** — Required for `ip tuntap`, `ip addr`, `ip link` commands used by the TUN management use case.

## [v1.3.5] - 2026-05-16

### Added
- **Topology — UE overflow popup panels** — Active 4G UE Sessions and Active 5G UE Sessions boxes now cap at 3 UEs displayed inline. If more than 3 UEs are active, a clickable "+ N more — click to view all" button appears at the bottom of the JointJS box. Clicking it opens a draggable floating panel (positioned absolutely over the canvas) showing all UEs with IP and IMSI. Panel is draggable by its header, auto-sizes to fit all UEs (max 400px scrollable), and has a close button. Separate panels for 4G and 5G.
- **RAN Network page — sortable UE sessions table** — IMSI, UE IP, and DNN/APN columns are now sortable. Clicking a header sorts ascending; clicking again toggles descending. Active sort column shows ↑↓ arrow indicator; inactive columns show ⇅. Sort is client-side in-memory — no API call.
- **Subscriber page — sortable columns** — IMSI, UE IPv4, and APN columns are now sortable. Sort is fully client-side (frontend `useMemo` sort) — no backend aggregation pipeline. Instant response with no page refetch. Clicking same column toggles asc/desc; clicking new column resets to asc.
- **Services page — 4G/5G group toggle buttons** — Two new toggle buttons in the services page header: blue "Start/Stop 5G" and amber "Start/Stop 4G". Each button reads the current running state and toggles accordingly. MongoDB is excluded from both groups. Backed by new optional `services` filter parameter on `POST /api/services/all/:action`.
- **Remote UPF management (UPF tab)** — New `UpfEditor.tsx` component with three sections:
  - **Local UPF** — edits `upf.yaml`, clearly labelled as the UPF on this host. Loopback warning on GTP-U address.
  - **SMF → UPF Connections** — edits `smf.yaml pfcp.client.upf` as a multi-entry list. Add/remove remote UPFs. Colour-coded local (green) vs remote (blue). Saves to `smf.yaml` on Apply Changes.
  - **Remote UPF YAML Generator** — Fill in PFCP and GTP-U addresses, session pool, DNS. Generates a ready-to-deploy `upf.yaml` for the remote machine. Copy/download buttons. "Add to SMF UPF List" button. Deployment instructions included. Auto-fills SMF real routable IP from config.
- **SMF config — DNN field on session pools** — Session pool rows now have a third `DNN (optional)` field alongside Subnet and Gateway.
- **SMF config — dual PFCP server addresses** — SMF PFCP server section now has two address fields: loopback (keep for local UPF) and optional real IP (for remote UPF to connect back to). Both are written to `smf.yaml pfcp.server[]`.
- **SBI Client defaults** — NRF URI defaults to `http://127.0.0.10:7777` and SCP URI defaults to `http://127.0.0.200:7777` when fields are empty.

### Fixed
- **Topology — MongoDB status light always red** — `mongodb` was not in the topology services list, so `statuses?.['mongodb']` was always `undefined` → always red regardless of actual state. Fixed by adding `mongodb` to the topology node list. Additionally, the topology endpoint now performs a **live** `getMongoStatus()` call (TCP ping + docker ps) on every topology load rather than relying on the polling cache.
- **Topology — MongoDB Docker detection** — `getServiceStatus()` was calling `isServiceActive()` which returns `false` without throwing when the systemd unit doesn't exist. The Docker fallback was in the `catch` block and never ran. Fixed: for `mongodb`, if `isServiceActive()` returns `false` (regardless of whether it throws), immediately call `getMongoDockerStatus()` before reporting inactive.
- **Topology — background dots removed** — `drawGrid: true` in JointJS paper config was rendering a dot grid over the canvas. Changed to `drawGrid: false`. Removed now-unused `drawGridSize` and `gridPattern` options.
- **Topology — thin grey border around map removed** — The container div had `border border-nms-border` class which drew a visible line around the entire topology canvas. Removed the border classes.
- **Log download — Docker tab greyed out** — The Docker Containers button in `LogDownloadModal` was hardcoded `disabled` with a `cursor-not-allowed` style. Removed the `disabled` attribute and made it a fully functional tab.
- **Log download — Docker containers not populated on modal open** — The download modal received `dockerContainers` as a prop from `LogsPage`, but `LogsPage` only fetched containers when the user had already clicked the Docker tab. Opening the download modal directly showed an empty container list. Fixed by adding a `useEffect` in `LogDownloadModal` that fetches containers from `/api/docker/containers` on mount, independent of the parent.
- **Log download — Docker containers not populated on main log page** — `LogsPage` only fetched containers when `logSource === 'docker'`. Changed to fetch on mount unconditionally so all containers are shown immediately.
- **Log download — all containers filtered to open5gs-nms only** — `DockerLogExecutor.getContainers()` used `--filter name=open5gs-nms`, hiding MongoDB and other containers. Removed the filter so all running containers are returned.
- **Log download — Docker logs using nsenter** — Docker log fetching was calling `executeCommand('bash', ['-c', 'docker logs ...'])` which routes through `nsenter`, causing failures. Changed to `spawn('docker', [...])` directly — the same approach used by the Unified Logs module which already works. `/var/run/docker.sock` is mounted into the container.
- **Log download — tar source directory not found** — Log files were being written to the host `/tmp` via `nsenter` but `tar` was running inside the container's `/tmp`. These are different filesystems. Fixed by using `fs.readFile`/`fs.writeFile` directly (since `/var/log/open5gs` and `/etc/open5gs` are mounted into the container) and running `tar` locally inside the container where all temp files exist.
- **SD values written with quotes in YAML** — `yaml-config-repository.ts` post-processing was enforcing `sd: "000001"` (with quotes). Open5GS config style uses unquoted SD values. The load side (`fixMccMncSdFromRawYaml`) already handles both forms on read. Fixed: post-processing now strips quotes → writes `sd: 000001` unquoted. Applies to AMF, SMF, and NSSF since all go through the same `saveRaw()` method.
- **Subscriber sort not working** — Sort was implemented as a MongoDB aggregation pipeline with `$addFields` + `$ifNull` on nested array fields. This was unreliable for missing/null values and added latency. Moved sorting entirely to the frontend: `fetchSubscribers()` always fetches in default IMSI order; `sortedSubscribers = useMemo(...)` sorts the current page in-memory using `localeCompare` with `numeric: true`. No backend changes needed per sort action.
- **403 permission denied — viewer could restart services and change configs** — `requireAdmin` middleware was missing from `service-controller` (POST routes), `config-controller` (validate/apply/sync-sd), `auto-config-controller` (preview/apply), `suci-controller` (all write routes), and `backup-controller` (all 11 write routes). Fixed by adding `requireAdmin` to every write route in every controller.
- **403 permission denied toast** — Added a 403 interceptor in the axios response interceptor that shows a `🔒 Permission denied` toast for any 403 response. Uses `id: 'forbidden'` to deduplicate.

### Changed
- **Topology — UE boxes capped at 3** — Both Active 4G UE Sessions and Active 5G UE Sessions boxes render a maximum of 3 UE cards inline. Overflow shown via the popup panel (see Added above). Box height stays fixed regardless of UE count.
- **Config page — SMF PFCP UPF field** — The single UPF address input in the SMF tab is now a read-only display showing current UPF list with a note "Manage in UPF tab". Full UPF list management moved to the UPF configuration tab.
- **Subscriber table** — Added APN and UE IPv4 columns. Removed session_count column. Sortable IMSI, APN, UE IPv4 headers.
- **MongoDB status source field** — `ServiceStatus` and frontend `ServiceStatus` type both now carry `source?: 'systemd' | 'docker' | 'direct'`. Services page shows a blue "docker" badge next to MONGODB when detected via Docker.
- **`SubscriberListItem`** — Added `ue_ipv4?: string` and `apn?: string` fields (backend entity + frontend type). These are extracted from the first session of the first slice and included in list projections.

### CHANGELOG
- v1.3.4 entries (MongoDB Docker detection, subscriber sorting, Docker container list fix, log download Docker tab fix) retroactively merged into v1.3.5 as all were part of the same development cycle.

---

## [v1.3.3] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- **Viewer role (read-only access)** — New `viewer` user role that can monitor everything but cannot make any changes. Admins can create viewer accounts and toggle existing users between admin and viewer from the User Management page.
  - Role selector on user create form (Admin / Viewer)
  - Role badges on user table (Shield = Admin, Eye = Viewer)
  - "Make Viewer / Make Admin" toggle button per user
  - Prevents demoting yourself or the last admin account
  - Amber "View-only mode" banner shown at top of every page for viewer sessions
  - All write routes on backend protected with `requireAdmin` middleware
- **403 permission denied toast** — When a viewer (or anyone) hits a protected endpoint, a `🔒 Permission denied` toast appears instead of a silent failure. Uses `id: 'forbidden'` to deduplicate multiple simultaneous 403s.
- **Subscriber CSV export** — `GET /api/subscribers/export?format=csv` streams all subscribers as a CSV file. Available to all users including viewers. Columns: `imsi, nickname, iccid, msisdn, ki, opc, amf, sst, sd, apn, type, ue_ipv4, ue_ipv6`.
- **Subscriber CSV import** — `POST /api/subscribers/import` (admin only). Accepts CSV with `{csv, mode}` where mode is `skip` (default) or `overwrite`. Returns `{imported, skipped, overwritten, errors[]}`. Import button with mode selector on Subscriber page.
- **Femtocell beta warning banner** — Red banner at top of Femtocell Provisioning tab indicating the module is under active development.
- **SUCI dual key format display** — Each key now shows two copyable formats:
  - Profile A (X25519): Raw 64-hex (Open5GS UDM) and `04`-prefixed 66-hex (SIM tools)
  - Profile B (secp256r1): Compressed 66-hex (Open5GS UDM) and uncompressed 130-hex (SIM tools)

### Fixed
- **Viewer role write access bug** — `requireAdmin` middleware was added to the `users-controller` but was missing from `service-controller`, `config-controller`, `auto-config-controller`, `suci-controller`, and `backup-controller`. Viewers could restart services and change configs. All write routes in all controllers now correctly enforce admin-only access.
- **Subscriber CSV import `ambr` validation error** — `rowToSubscriber` was missing the required top-level `ambr` field on the subscriber document. Open5GS schema requires `ambr` at both the subscriber level and the session level. Import was failing with `ambr: required` on every row.
- **Subscriber CSV import session type** — Import was hardcoding `type: 3` (IPv4v6). Now reads from the `type` CSV column and defaults to `1` (IPv4) if blank. Supports all three values: `1` = IPv4, `2` = IPv6, `3` = IPv4v6.
- **Subscriber CSV import IPv6 address** — Added `ue_ipv6` column to CSV. Import correctly builds `ue: { ipv4, ipv6 }` object with only the fields that are populated.
- **`UserRole` type** — Domain entity `UserRole` was typed as `'admin'` only, causing TypeScript to reject `'viewer'` everywhere it flowed through. Fixed to `'admin' | 'viewer'`.
- **`SafeUser` missing `createdAt`** — Frontend was casting `(u as any).createdAt` because the field was absent from the `SafeUser` interface. Added to interface and `toSafeUser()` mapper.

### Changed
- **User Management page** — Rewritten to include role management, role badges, and improved UX. Role selector on create form. Toggle button per user. Prevents self-demotion and removing last admin.
- **Subscriber page** — Export CSV button always visible (including viewer). Import CSV, Add, Edit, Delete, SIM Generator, and Auto-Assign IPs hidden for viewer role.
- **CSV format** — Added `type`, `ue_ipv4`, `ue_ipv6` columns. Removed `ul_mbps`, `dl_mbps` (not used by Open5GS). All values now round-trip correctly through export → import.

---

## [v1.3.2] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed
- **Femtocell provisioning success detection** — Replaced brittle 3-string `allOk` check with correct logic. Previous check required `[+] OK  sasConf` even when SAS was disabled, causing every non-SAS provision to report failure. Corrected string matching to include `.htm` suffixes. Added conditional sasConf check and `noFailures` fallback.
- **Femtocell output panel color** — Red/green border and icon now key off `[-] FAILED` (exact script failure marker) instead of `FAILED`. Reboot wait `[!]` warning lines no longer turn the panel red on a successful provision.
- **Femtocell error toast duration** — Extended to 8 seconds with "Check output for details" so the output panel is readable before the toast disappears.
- **Femtocell probe config regression** — A failed attempt to fix checkbox detection via a `--probe-config` subcommand introduced Python syntax errors and corrupted the inline regex strings in the probe Step 3 block (`{{name}}` double-braces and stray `]` characters broke rf-string interpolation). Rolled back both `femto-controller.ts` and `femto_provision.py` to the v1.3.1 working state. The probe correctly pulls and pre-fills all text fields; checkbox pre-fill (Admin State, Carrier Aggregation, Contiguous CC, Auto Internal Neighbors) remains a known issue for a future fix.
- **SUCI Profile A SIM provisioning key** — Removed incorrect `04` prefix from X25519 public key. X25519 keys are raw 32 bytes (64 hex) with no point-compression prefix. The `04` prefix is secp256r1 uncompressed-point notation and is invalid for X25519. Both Open5GS UDM and SIM provisioning tools (pySIM, sysmoUSIM) use the same raw 32-byte format for Profile A.

### Added
- **SUCI dual key display** — KeyCard now shows two separate copyable keys per entry:
  - **Open5GS UDM Key** — compressed/raw format for `udm.yaml` hnet block
  - **SIM Provisioning Key** — format required by pySIM/sysmoUSIM when programming eSIMs
  - Profile B (secp256r1): UDM shows compressed 66 hex, SIM tools show uncompressed 130 hex
  - Profile A (X25519): both show the same raw 64-hex value with a label clarifying they are identical
  - Each key has its own Copy button; sublabels show exact byte format and length per profile

### Changed
- **`HnetKey` frontend type** — Added `publicKeyUncompressed: string | null` field to match the backend (which already returned this value).
- **SUCI usage info** — KeyCard usage blurb now references correct `scheme` and `id` values inline for both key types.

### Known Issues
- **Femtocell probe checkboxes** — Admin State, Carrier Aggregation, Contiguous CC, and Auto Internal Neighbors always show unchecked on probe regardless of device state. Root cause: Sercomm omits the checkbox `<input>` element when unchecked (standard HTML), so the `checked`-attribute regex always returns false. Fix requires reading the `h_<field>` hidden inputs instead. Deferred.

---

## [v1.3.1] - 2026-05-02

### Fixed
- **Port conflict with FoHSS IMS HSS** — Frontend internal port changed from 8080 to 8081. FoHSS (IMS Home Subscriber Server used in VoLTE setups) also binds port 8080, causing the frontend container to fail to start. Updated `frontend/Dockerfile`, `nginx/nginx.conf`, `docker-compose.yml`, and `.env.example`.

### Improved
- **Femtocell probe** — Probe endpoint now uses Python `requests` instead of Node.js `https` module. Node TLS rejects old Sercomm self-signed certificates; Python handles them correctly.
- **Femtocell reboot wait** — `wait_for_webui_reboot` and `wait_for_webui_up` no longer call `sys.exit(1)` on timeout. Reboot wait is now best-effort — script exits 0 if all config pages saved successfully, regardless of reboot timing. Timeouts increased from 300s to 600s.

---

## [v1.3.0] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- **Femtocell Provisioning tab** (Auto Config page) — Full provisioning UI for Sercomm SCE4255W CBRS small cells
  - Auto-detects WebUI status on IP field blur
  - Automatically fetches MAC via `sc_femto` SSH and derives credentials using calc_f2 algorithm
  - Pulls and pre-fills current device config from `devComState.htm`
  - Configures radio (Band 48 dual-carrier defaults), S1/core, SAS/location, and CWMP settings
  - MME IP auto-populated from Open5GS MME config
  - Browser geolocation support for SAS lat/long (micro-degrees format)
  - Dry run and live provision with full script output displayed on completion
  - `femto_provision.py` bundled in backend Docker image at `/app/tools/`
  - Backend endpoints: `GET /api/femto/probe`, `POST /api/femto/provision`
- **Auto Config page tabs** — "Open5GS Auto Config" and "Femtocell Provisioning" tabs

### Fixed
- **Service restart logout bug** — `window.location.reload()` after service actions replaced with `fetchStatuses()`. Page reload was dropping the session cookie on HTTP connections where `secure:true` cookies are silently ignored by the browser.
- **COOKIE_SECURE env var** — Was declared in `.env.example` but never read by the application. Now properly wired through `config/index.ts` → `createLucia()` → session cookie attributes.
- **GLIBC mismatch on Ubuntu 24.04** — `nsenter` now passes bare command names instead of full paths (e.g. `systemctl` not `/usr/bin/systemctl`). Node resolves full paths before `nsenter` runs, picking up container binaries that require an older GLIBC. Bare names resolve after entering the host mount namespace, using the host's own binaries and GLIBC. Fixes `GLIBC_2.39 not found` error reported on Ubuntu 24.04 Noble.
- **pySIM bundled** — Removed `git clone` of pysim from Dockerfile. `suci-keytool.py` and `osmocom/` package now bundled directly in `backend/tools/`. Eliminates build-time dependency on `gitea.osmocom.org`.

### Changed
- **nginx** — Added `/api/femto/` location block with `proxy_buffering off` and 700s timeout, placed before `/api/` block to ensure correct routing.
- **Dockerfile** — Added `paramiko` and `requests` to pip install for `femto_provision.py`.

---

## [v1.2.8] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed
- **Session logout on service restart** — Replaced `window.location.reload()` with `fetchStatuses()` in `ServicesPage.tsx`.
- **COOKIE_SECURE** — Added `cookieSecure` field to `AppConfig`, read from `COOKIE_SECURE` env var (default `false`). Wired through to Lucia session cookie. Previously this env var was ignored.
- **GLIBC fix (Ubuntu 24.04)** — Bare command names passed to `nsenter` (initial fix; refined in v1.3.0).

---

## [v1.2.7] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- **Subscriber nickname field** — Shown in table (accent color) and edit form. Stored in MongoDB alongside Open5GS fields, invisible to core network.
- **Subscriber ICCID field** — Shown in table (monospace) and edit form. SIM Generator auto-provision saves ICCID to subscriber record.
- **pySIM JSON modal fixes** — secp256r1 (Profile B) now extracts compressed key (66 hex chars, 02/03 prefix) matching pySIM and 3GPP TS 33.501.

---

## [v1.2.6] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- **pySIM JSON generator** — One-click generation of correctly formatted `EF.SUCI_Calc_Info` JSON for pySIM-shell. Pretty and single-line formats. Accessible from SUCI Key Management page.
- **Full backup download** — Single `.tar.gz` containing all 16 NF config YAMLs + MongoDB dump. Disaster recovery from a single file.
- **Full backup restore** — Upload `.tar.gz` to restore entire system from scratch.
- **MongoDB service tracking** — MongoDB added as tracked service (`mongod` unit). Status circle on topology page. First in restart order since all NFs depend on it.
- **Open5GS internal API integration** — Active sessions and interface status now use Open5GS AMF/MME/SMF APIs directly instead of `tshark`/`conntrack`/`netstat`.
- **UE-to-radio mapping** — RAN Network page shows which eNodeB/gNodeB each UE is connected to.
- **THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md** — License notices for pysim (GPL-2.0), Open5GS (AGPL-3.0), JointJS (MPL-2.0), pyosmocom, pycryptodomex, and npm dependencies.

### Fixed
- **tar directory name bug** — Full backup was failing due to inconsistent directory naming between `mkdir` and `tar` steps.

---

## [v1.2.5] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- **SUCI Key Management** — Generate X25519 (Profile A) and secp256r1 (Profile B) home network keypairs. Automatic UDM config update. Multiple PKI IDs supported. Rename PKI ID without destroying keys.
- **SIM Generator** — Generate test SIM credentials with country-based MCC selection (65+ countries). Auto-provision generated SIMs to Open5GS.
- **Topology page improvements** — Dynamic height for 4G Radio Network Status box. `scaleContentToFit` on load. `ResizeObserver` for window resize.
- **MME security algorithms** — Interactive EIA/EEA editor matching AMF NAS security editor pattern.

---

## [v1.2.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- **Auto Config page** — One-click Open5GS network configuration. Supports multiple PLMNs for 4G (MME) and 5G (AMF). NAT/iptables configuration. YAML diff preview before applying.

- Subscriber management (CRUD via MongoDB)
- Configuration editor for all 16 Open5GS NF YAML files
- Service management (start/stop/restart via systemctl)
- Real-time log streaming
