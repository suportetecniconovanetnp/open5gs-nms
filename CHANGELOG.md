## [v1.3.3] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- **Viewer role (read-only access)** — New `viewer` user role that can monitor everything but cannot make any changes. Admins can create viewer accounts and toggle existing users between admin and viewer from the User Management page.
  - Role selector on user create form (Admin / Viewer)
  - Role badges on user table (Shield = Admin, Eye = Viewer)
  - "Make Viewer / Make Admin" toggle button per user
  - Prevents demoting yourself or the last admin account
  - Amber "View-only mode" banner shown at top of every page for viewer sessions
  - All write routes on backend protected with `requireAdmin` middleware
- **403 permission denied toast** — When a viewer (or anyone) hits a protected endpoint, a `🔒 Permission denied` toast appears instead of a silent failure. Uses `id: 'forbidden'` to deduplicate multiple simultaneous 403s.
- **Subscriber CSV export** — `GET /api/subscribers/export?format=csv` streams all subscribers as a CSV file. Available to all users including viewers. Columns: `imsi, nickname, iccid, msisdn, ki, opc, amf, sst, sd, apn, type, ue_ipv4, ue_ipv6`.
- **Subscriber CSV import** — `POST /api/subscribers/import` (admin only). Accepts CSV with `{csv, mode}` where mode is `skip` (default) or `overwrite`. Returns `{imported, skipped, overwritten, errors[]}`. Import button with mode selector on Subscriber page.
- **Femtocell beta warning banner** — Red banner at top of Femtocell Provisioning tab indicating the module is under active development.
- **SUCI dual key format display** — Each key now shows two copyable formats:
  - Profile A (X25519): Raw 64-hex (Open5GS UDM) and `04`-prefixed 66-hex (SIM tools)
  - Profile B (secp256r1): Compressed 66-hex (Open5GS UDM) and uncompressed 130-hex (SIM tools)

### Fixed
- **Viewer role write access bug** — `requireAdmin` middleware was added to the `users-controller` but was missing from `service-controller`, `config-controller`, `auto-config-controller`, `suci-controller`, and `backup-controller`. Viewers could restart services and change configs. All write routes in all controllers now correctly enforce admin-only access.
- **Subscriber CSV import `ambr` validation error** — `rowToSubscriber` was missing the required top-level `ambr` field on the subscriber document. Open5GS schema requires `ambr` at both the subscriber level and the session level. Import was failing with `ambr: required` on every row.
- **Subscriber CSV import session type** — Import was hardcoding `type: 3` (IPv4v6). Now reads from the `type` CSV column and defaults to `1` (IPv4) if blank. Supports all three values: `1` = IPv4, `2` = IPv6, `3` = IPv4v6.
- **Subscriber CSV import IPv6 address** — Added `ue_ipv6` column to CSV. Import correctly builds `ue: { ipv4, ipv6 }` object with only the fields that are populated.
- **`UserRole` type** — Domain entity `UserRole` was typed as `'admin'` only, causing TypeScript to reject `'viewer'` everywhere it flowed through. Fixed to `'admin' | 'viewer'`.
- **`SafeUser` missing `createdAt`** — Frontend was casting `(u as any).createdAt` because the field was absent from the `SafeUser` interface. Added to interface and `toSafeUser()` mapper.

### Changed
- **User Management page** — Rewritten to include role management, role badges, and improved UX. Role selector on create form. Toggle button per user. Prevents self-demotion and removing last admin.
- **Subscriber page** — Export CSV button always visible (including viewer). Import CSV, Add, Edit, Delete, SIM Generator, and Auto-Assign IPs hidden for viewer role.
- **CSV format** — Added `type`, `ue_ipv4`, `ue_ipv6` columns. Removed `ul_mbps`, `dl_mbps` (not used by Open5GS). All values now round-trip correctly through export → import.

## [v1.3.2] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed
- **Femtocell provisioning success detection** — Replaced brittle 3-string `allOk` check with correct logic. Previous check required `[+] OK  sasConf` even when SAS was disabled, causing every non-SAS provision to report failure. Corrected string matching to include `.htm` suffixes. Added conditional sasConf check and `noFailures` fallback.
- **Femtocell output panel color** — Red/green border and icon now key off `[-] FAILED` (exact script failure marker) instead of `FAILED`. Reboot wait `[!]` warning lines no longer turn the panel red on a successful provision.
- **Femtocell error toast duration** — Extended to 8 seconds with "Check output for details" so the output panel is readable before the toast disappears.
- **Femtocell probe config regression** — A failed attempt to fix checkbox detection via a `--probe-config` subcommand introduced Python syntax errors and corrupted the inline regex strings in the probe Step 3 block (`{{name}}` double-braces and stray `]` characters broke rf-string interpolation). Rolled back both `femto-controller.ts` and `femto_provision.py` to the v1.3.1 working state. The probe correctly pulls and pre-fills all text fields; checkbox pre-fill (Admin State, Carrier Aggregation, Contiguous CC, Auto Internal Neighbors) remains a known issue for a future fix.
- **SUCI Profile A SIM provisioning key** — Removed incorrect `04` prefix from X25519 public key. X25519 keys are raw 32 bytes (64 hex) with no point-compression prefix. The `04` prefix is secp256r1 uncompressed-point notation and is invalid for X25519. Both Open5GS UDM and SIM provisioning tools (pySIM, sysmoUSIM) use the same raw 32-byte format for Profile A.

### Added
- **SUCI dual key display** — KeyCard now shows two separate copyable keys per entry:
  - **Open5GS UDM Key** — compressed/raw format for `udm.yaml` hnet block
  - **SIM Provisioning Key** — format required by pySIM/sysmoUSIM when programming eSIMs
  - Profile B (secp256r1): UDM shows compressed 66 hex, SIM tools show uncompressed 130 hex
  - Profile A (X25519): both show the same raw 64-hex value with a label clarifying they are identical
  - Each key has its own Copy button; sublabels show exact byte format and length per profile

### Changed
- **`HnetKey` frontend type** — Added `publicKeyUncompressed: string | null` field to match the backend (which already returned this value).
- **SUCI usage info** — KeyCard usage blurb now references correct `scheme` and `id` values inline for both key types.

### Known Issues
- **Femtocell probe checkboxes** — Admin State, Carrier Aggregation, Contiguous CC, and Auto Internal Neighbors always show unchecked on probe regardless of device state. Root cause: Sercomm omits the checkbox `<input>` element when unchecked (standard HTML), so the `checked`-attribute regex always returns false. Fix requires reading the `h_<field>` hidden inputs instead. Deferred.

## [v1.3.1] - 2026-05-02

### Fixed
- **Port conflict with FoHSS IMS HSS** — Frontend internal port changed from 8080 to 8081. FoHSS (IMS Home Subscriber Server used in VoLTE setups) also binds port 8080, causing the frontend container to fail to start. Updated `frontend/Dockerfile`, `nginx/nginx.conf`, `docker-compose.yml`, and `.env.example`.

### Improved
- **Femtocell probe** — Probe endpoint now uses Python `requests` instead of Node.js `https` module. Node TLS rejects old Sercomm self-signed certificates; Python handles them correctly.
- **Femtocell reboot wait** — `wait_for_webui_reboot` and `wait_for_webui_up` no longer call `sys.exit(1)` on timeout. Reboot wait is now best-effort — script exits 0 if all config pages saved successfully, regardless of reboot timing. Timeouts increased from 300s to 600s.

## [v1.3.0] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- **Femtocell Provisioning tab** (Auto Config page) — Full provisioning UI for Sercomm SCE4255W CBRS small cells
  - Auto-detects WebUI status on IP field blur
  - Automatically fetches MAC via `sc_femto` SSH and derives credentials using calc_f2 algorithm
  - Pulls and pre-fills current device config from `devComState.htm`
  - Configures radio (Band 48 dual-carrier defaults), S1/core, SAS/location, and CWMP settings
  - MME IP auto-populated from Open5GS MME config
  - Browser geolocation support for SAS lat/long (micro-degrees format)
  - Dry run and live provision with full script output displayed on completion
  - `femto_provision.py` bundled in backend Docker image at `/app/tools/`
  - Backend endpoints: `GET /api/femto/probe`, `POST /api/femto/provision`
- **Auto Config page tabs** — "Open5GS Auto Config" and "Femtocell Provisioning" tabs

### Fixed
- **Service restart logout bug** — `window.location.reload()` after service actions replaced with `fetchStatuses()`. Page reload was dropping the session cookie on HTTP connections where `secure:true` cookies are silently ignored by the browser.
- **COOKIE_SECURE env var** — Was declared in `.env.example` but never read by the application. Now properly wired through `config/index.ts` → `createLucia()` → session cookie attributes.
- **GLIBC mismatch on Ubuntu 24.04** — `nsenter` now passes bare command names instead of full paths (e.g. `systemctl` not `/usr/bin/systemctl`). Node resolves full paths before `nsenter` runs, picking up container binaries that require an older GLIBC. Bare names resolve after entering the host mount namespace, using the host's own binaries and GLIBC. Fixes `GLIBC_2.39 not found` error reported on Ubuntu 24.04 Noble.
- **pySIM bundled** — Removed `git clone` of pysim from Dockerfile. `suci-keytool.py` and `osmocom/` package now bundled directly in `backend/tools/`. Eliminates build-time dependency on `gitea.osmocom.org`.

### Changed
- **nginx** — Added `/api/femto/` location block with `proxy_buffering off` and 700s timeout, placed before `/api/` block to ensure correct routing.
- **Dockerfile** — Added `paramiko` and `requests` to pip install for `femto_provision.py`.

---

## [v1.2.8] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed
- **Session logout on service restart** — Replaced `window.location.reload()` with `fetchStatuses()` in `ServicesPage.tsx`.
- **COOKIE_SECURE** — Added `cookieSecure` field to `AppConfig`, read from `COOKIE_SECURE` env var (default `false`). Wired through to Lucia session cookie. Previously this env var was ignored.
- **GLIBC fix (Ubuntu 24.04)** — Bare command names passed to `nsenter` (initial fix; refined in v1.3.0).

---

## [v1.2.7] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- **Subscriber nickname field** — Shown in table (accent color) and edit form. Stored in MongoDB alongside Open5GS fields, invisible to core network.
- **Subscriber ICCID field** — Shown in table (monospace) and edit form. SIM Generator auto-provision saves ICCID to subscriber record.
- **pySIM JSON modal fixes** — secp256r1 (Profile B) now extracts compressed key (66 hex chars, 02/03 prefix) matching pySIM and 3GPP TS 33.501.

---

## [v1.2.6] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- **pySIM JSON generator** — One-click generation of correctly formatted `EF.SUCI_Calc_Info` JSON for pySIM-shell. Pretty and single-line formats. Accessible from SUCI Key Management page.
- **Full backup download** — Single `.tar.gz` containing all 16 NF config YAMLs + MongoDB dump. Disaster recovery from a single file.
- **Full backup restore** — Upload `.tar.gz` to restore entire system from scratch.
- **MongoDB service tracking** — MongoDB added as tracked service (`mongod` unit). Status circle on topology page. First in restart order since all NFs depend on it.
- **Open5GS internal API integration** — Active sessions and interface status now use Open5GS AMF/MME/SMF APIs directly instead of `tshark`/`conntrack`/`netstat`.
- **UE-to-radio mapping** — RAN Network page shows which eNodeB/gNodeB each UE is connected to.
- **THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md** — License notices for pysim (GPL-2.0), Open5GS (AGPL-3.0), JointJS (MPL-2.0), pyosmocom, pycryptodomex, and npm dependencies.

### Fixed
- **tar directory name bug** — Full backup was failing due to inconsistent directory naming between `mkdir` and `tar` steps.

---

## [v1.2.5] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- **SUCI Key Management** — Generate X25519 (Profile A) and secp256r1 (Profile B) home network keypairs. Automatic UDM config update. Multiple PKI IDs supported. Rename PKI ID without destroying keys.
- **SIM Generator** — Generate test SIM credentials with country-based MCC selection (65+ countries). Auto-provision generated SIMs to Open5GS.
- **Topology page improvements** — Dynamic height for 4G Radio Network Status box. `scaleContentToFit` on load. `ResizeObserver` for window resize.
